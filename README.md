A simple program for checking Terms and Conditions , where the T&C is broken into sections 
for review that the user can approve, deny, or skip, and duplicate sections of new T&C will
be auto-tagged with the previous response. 

T&C are used as a plain text file, and T&C can be copied and pasted into a text file to be used in 
the program. Prior reponses are stored locally in a JSON file at the same path as main.py. 

An exe is in the zipped folder for ease of use, but uses a seperate JSON file.
